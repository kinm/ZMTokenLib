    "description": "Tranchess is a tokenized asset management and derivatives trading protocol. Inspired by tranche funds that cater to investors with different risk appetite, Tranchess aims to provide a different risk/return matrix out of a single main fund that tracks a specific underlying asset (e.g.BTC). The main tranche can be split into two sub-tranches with their own distinct risk return profile.\r\nTranchess Protocol is not a standalone  asset management ecosystem, but encompasses all features one can find in the DeFi space. It is a one-stop centre for those that wants to enjoy popular DeFi features- such as single-asset yield farming, borrowing & lending, trading, etc..",
