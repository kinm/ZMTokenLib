    "description": "EverGrow is a deflationary token designed to become more scarce over time through regular burn. All holders of $EGC will earn an 8% reward from every Buy/Transfer/Sell Transaction in $BUSD. Since launch, EverGrow have distributed $37.5 million $BUSD to our holders - the most of any project in history.\r\n\r\n2% from Every Buy/Sell Transaction is sent to Buy-Back wallet, with 2% transferred into the liquidity pool to create a stable price floor. EverGrow Ecosystem consists of LunaSky - our NFT Marketplace, Crator - the world's first social media platform to integrate crypto payments, and our metaverse partnership with The Abstract - bringing crypto services and gaming into an immersive 3d world.\r\n\r\nAll profits from our utilities are used for BuyBack&Burn - generating rewards and positive price action, while continuously reducing supply.",
