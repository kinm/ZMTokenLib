    "description": "What is Vyvo Smart Chain Network?\r\n\r\nVyvo Smart Chain Network is a Layer 1 Ethereum-compatible blockchain network. It is the latest blockchain framework that aims to ensure data security and decentralization through hybrid Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Sensing (PoSe) validation protocols.\r\n\r\nWhat is Vyvo Coin $(VSC)?\r\n\r\nVyvo Coin ($VSC) is the native cryptocurrency of Vyvo Smart Chain Network. It is used for various purposes within the ecosystem, including staking and rewarding users for contributions.\r\n\r\nHow the Burn-and-Mint Economics will work in Vyvo Smart Chain? \r\n\r\nThe Vyvo Coin (VSC) to Vyvo Data Credit (VDC) relationship is based on burn-and-mint equilibrium. This relationshipâ€™s intent is to allow for a supply of VSC to respond to Data purchase trends such that, when equilibrium is reached, the amount of VSC that currently exists remains static month-to-month. The amount of VDC produced by burning VSC will fluctuate based on the USD price of VSC.",
