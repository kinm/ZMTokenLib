    "description": "USDtb shares characteristics with existing fiat stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, seeking to maintain a stable value pegged to the US dollar by utilizing cash or cash-equivalent reserves. Users are able to transfer USDtb freely and without restriction. USDtb is able to scale without practical constraints given the use of Blackrockâ€™s BUIDL as the primary reserve  asset, representing the vast majority (90%) of the overall reserves - the highest BUIDL allocation of any stablecoin.\r\n",
