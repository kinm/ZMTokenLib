    "description": "Bedrock's native tokenized version of staked Ether is known as uniETH.\r\n\r\nuniETH represents the staked ETH in Bedrock plus all future staking rewards. uniETH is non-rebasing, i.e. does not grow in quantity over time but grows in value instead. In other words, 1 uniETH will be worth more than 1 ETH as time goes on, and its value will continue to increase as more time passes.\r\n\r\nLaunched by RockX, Bedrock is a non-custodial solution that satisfies the requirements of institutions seeking a basis for large-scale liquid staking. By bringing new levels of transparency and security to liquid staking, Bedrock allows institutions to unlock liquidity safely by adhering to regulations while leveraging a true crypto-native solution.\r\n",
