    "description": "Rocket Pool is Ethereumâ€™s most decentralised liquid staking protocol.\r\nLiquid stakers can participate by depositing as little as 0.01 ETH to receive the rETH liquid staking token.\r\nRocket Pool is a fully non-custodial solution, and its node operators are economically-aligned to perform well for stakers. Joining as a node operator is fully permissionless and requires just 16 ETH (instead of the usual 32). A boosted ROI is provided from both operator commission plus RPL rewards. The Rocket Pool team have been in the staking space since its inception in 2016, which gives them a pedigree and track record without peer.",
