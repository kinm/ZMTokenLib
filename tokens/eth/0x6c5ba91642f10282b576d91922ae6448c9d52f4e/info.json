    "description": "What Is Phala Network (PHA)?\r\nPhala Network is a coprocessor for blockchains. Developers deploy “Phat Contracts,” off-chain program for coprocessors, enhancing dApps with connectivity, internet access, and heavy computation, overcoming web3 constraints.\r\n\r\nPhala Network has one of the largest Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) on Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) hardware, which means that any code/data on Phala Network is protected from unauthorized access by users. Phala addresses developer concerns with expanded developer language support such as JavaScript and more, and ready-to-deploy Templates for seamless Phat Contract integration, streamlining the experience for web3 developers.\r\n\r\nPhala stands at the forefront of Web3 innovation, fostering development through its Builders Program.\r\n\r\nHow Many PHA Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\nThere is a maximum supply of 10 billion PHA. As of January 17th, 2024, the circulating supply of PHA tokens is 663,448,259. Please note that the circulating supply is dynamic. For the most up-to-date information on the circulating supply, please visit the API here.\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Phala Network?\r\nMarvin Tong: CEO of Hash Forest Technologies. Senior Product Manager. Ex Tencent and Didi. 【X】【LinkedIn】\r\n\r\nHang Yin: CTO of Hash Forest Technologies. Founder and Lead Developer of Bitcoin Gold. Senior Developer at Google. 10 years of coding experience. 【X】【LinkedIn】【Github】\r\n\r\nWhere Can I Buy Phala (PHA)?\r\nAs one of the most potential Polkadot and EVM ecosystem projects in terms of coprocessor, PHA is available on some top-ranked exchanges below\r\n\r\nBinance\r\n\r\nKraken\r\n\r\nOKX\r\n\r\nKucoin\r\n\r\nUniswap\r\n\r\n1inch\r\n\r\nHydraDX Omnipool\r\n\r\nFor the full list, please visit here.\r\n\r\nPHA resources\r\nIntroduction to PHA the native token of Phala Blockchain\r\n\r\nPHA Governance\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nDiscord\r\n\r\nPhala Network Blog\r\n\r\nPhala Network Docs\r\n\r\nGitHub\r\n\r\nYouTube\r\n\r\nCMC community\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Phala Unique?\r\nPhala Networks pioneers DePIN for CPUs, optimizing performance. Decentralized compute enhances blockchain coprocessors, ensuring secure transactions. The future entails AI-Web3 synergy, with Autonomous Agents providing scalable, autonomous data processing.\r\n\r\nPhala Network distinguishes itself through its Phat Contracts, a paradigm-shifting concept in decentralized off-chain computation. The key uniqueness of Phat Contracts lies in their role as decentralized computation units, surpassing the limitations of on-chain smart contracts. These contracts run off-chain, facilitating complex computations seamlessly and cost-effectively. Unlike traditional on-chain solutions, Phat Contracts enable connections across diverse blockchains, supporting EVM and Substrate-based chains like Ethereum, Polygon, Polkadot, and more.\r\n\r\nPhat Contracts empower developers with a range of tools—such as the Rust SDK and JavaScript and TypeScript—providing flexibility based on their programming background.\r\n\r\nPhat Contract applications include Zurf for web3 social rewards, Phat OTP for secure on-chain authentication, Phat Strategy in GameFi, Lens Phite for dynamic NFTs, Smart Cookie for AI-driven content tailoring, and LensAPI Oracle for seamless integration of Lens data in smart contracts.\r\n\r\nPHA is the native utility token that is used for:\r\nTrusted Computing Resources: Phala Networks empowers users with $PHA to access TEE computation resources. Seamlessly deploy Phat Contracts, supporting smart contracts as self-host oracles on various EVM blockchains.\r\n\r\nSecurity Guarantee: Gatekeepers must stake a certain amount of PHA tokens, which may be slashed for misbehavior.\r\n\r\nGovernance: Stakeholders who own a certain amount of PHA are able to join the Phala DAO to participate in community governance.\r\n\r\nPhala products include:\r\nPhat Contract\r\n\r\nSubBridge\r\n\r\ninDEX\r\n\r\nPhalaWorld",
