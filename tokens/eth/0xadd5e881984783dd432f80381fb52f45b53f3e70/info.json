    "description": "Vite has built the world’s first DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based smart-contract platform, with a Snapshot Chain structure to facilitate zero-fee transactions and optimize transaction speed, reliability, and security. The Snapshot Chain of Vite utilizes Hierarchical Delegated Proof of Stake (“HDPoS”) to achieve network consensus. \r\n\r\nVite’s current products include a truly trustless DEX (ViteX), a wallet-centric super-app (Vite App) and a Vite-based payment rail (VitePay).\r\n\r\nVite’s next ambition is ViteBridge, a universal cross-chain solution that allows easy asset transfer between any two chains in a decentralized manner.",
