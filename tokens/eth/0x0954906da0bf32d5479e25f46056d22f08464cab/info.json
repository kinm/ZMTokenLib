    "description": "Index Coop is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that builds structured DeFi products and strategy tokens. Index Coop offers a suite of sector index products, leverage and inverse products, and yield-generating products. The product suite runs on Set Protocol, an audited, self-custodial DeFi tool that allows for the creation and management of Ethereum-based (or ERC-20) tokens. Changes to the DAO are voted on by the owners of a governance token called INDEX and then implemented by a team of developers. INDEX holders wield voting power on a 1:1 basis, meaning one token equals one vote.",
