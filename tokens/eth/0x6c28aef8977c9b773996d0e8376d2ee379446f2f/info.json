    "description": "QuickSwap is the leading DEX on Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM, & Dogechain, best known for it's blazing fast transaction speeds and near-zero gas fees. The DEX was launched in 2020 & provides DeFi features such as swaps, liquidity providing, farming, & staking.\r\n\r\nIt's also home to the DragonFi ecosystem, a powerful DeFi product suite that includes a decentralized Perpetual Exchange (QuickPerps), Gaming Hub, and much more.\r\n\r\n$QUICK (OLD) is the existing version of QuickSwap's native token - a token split took place in 2022 that redenominated it to New $QUICK at a 1:1000 ratio. The Old $QUICK token does not have any utility on the DEX, so users can convert to New $QUICK via QuickSwap's converter & stake in the Dragon's Lair to earn yield, in addition to farming the token to earn rewards.\r\n",
