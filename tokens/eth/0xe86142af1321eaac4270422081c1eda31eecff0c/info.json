Since January 2020, Yay! offers over 9 million users a place where users find their interests, get connected, create community, casually make group calls, and more.

Staking Campaign is designed to strengthen the Yay! ecosystem liquidity by allowing users to earn various rewards through participation. The campaign primarily targets Yay! supporters, encouraging them to stake their assets with protocol partners such as StakeStone, Kelp, and others via Yay! Dashboard.
