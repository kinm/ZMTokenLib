    "description": "\"KISHU INU was created in April 2021 with the goal of being a decentralized meme project with true purpose.\r\n\r\nKISHU’s mission is to bring popular cryptocurrency concepts to the mainstream. Unlike older, comparable projects, KISHU introduces holders to next-gen concepts such as participation rewards, NFTs, decentralized exchanges, and more.\r\n\r\nWithin the first month of its launch, KISHU made history by surpassing a $2 billion market cap and over 100,000 holders. This was an unprecedented milestone for a project of its kind, and proved the world’s belief in the project.\"",
