    "description": "\r\n***French Connection Finance (FCF)***\r\n\r\nWhat is French Connection Finance (FCF)?\r\n\r\nFrench Connection Finance is all about “Empowering Crypto.” As a utility-first crypto company, we launched our crypto payment gateway for e-commerce and brick-and-mortar stores called FCF Pay in February 2022, bridging the gap between crypto and commerce. We empower cryptocurrency holders by allowing them to purchase goods and services through our fully-encrypted cryptocurrency payment gateway. Merchants can accept payment in a wide range of cryptocurrencies, via a fiat to crypto credit/debit card on-ramp or even bank transfer. They can also convert it simply and easily to fiat. This is all made simple by our easy-to-use dashboard.\r\n\r\n$FCF is our Revenue Sharing Token (RST). All $FCF RST holders get rewarded with fully automated dividends, paid in BNB every 24 hours. These dividends come from a share of the $FCF RST token transaction tax, as well as a share of every transaction fee from FCF Pay, allowing holders to earn passive income while benefiting from the rising price of $FCF RST. Over 1 million USD worth of dividends has been disbursed to holders so far. French Connection Finance was recently recognized as the Most Innovative Project 2022 at the Crypto Expo Dubai. $FCF RST is Certik verified, registered in Canada and has a fully doxxed CEO and team.\r\n\r\nWho are the Founders of French Connection Finance?\r\n\r\nThe French Connection Finance team consists of seasoned entrepreneurs. FCF is led by John Nasr, who is the Founder & CEO. John is an accomplished entrepreneur with over 10 years of experience in the business development industry. Passionate about cryptocurrency since 2013, John jumped into the De-Fi world after becoming tired of all the scams and failed De-Fi projects. He decided to create FCF and revolutionize the De-Fi world and take it where it belongs. Joe Parkin serves as COO for FCF. Joe is an entrepreneur, all-roun",
